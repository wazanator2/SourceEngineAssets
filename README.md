<B>How to commit</B>

To start navigate to the folder you wish to contribute to. For this example lets assume you are contributing some brick materials so you would go to the materials/brick folder. You would then put your brick textures .vtf and .vmt into this folder. Next you would open up the Credits.txt file (or create one if it doesn't already exist) and add the proper credits like so:

Textures Name       =        Original Artists Name

Next you would go to the folder you contributed to (in this case materials), right click and choose "Tortoise Git-> Add..." select everything you wish to send and then press OK. 

Wait for it to all upload.

Once it is done click Commit. Message is where you will give a short description of what you are uploading, be sure you put one in. Click OK.

After it creates choose "Push...". Go with default settings (local = master, remote = master, remote = origin). Click OK then when it asks for login info use your GitHub username and password.


Wait for the push to finish.

Go to your Forks page (should be something like https://github.com/USERNAME/SourceEngineAssets/) and press the green button labled "Compare, review, create a pull request". Click Create Pull Request. Give it a title and a description of what you are sending to the main branch then click the green button to send it. That's it the pull request as been sent, I'll review it and accept it if all is in order, if not I'll leave a comment explaining why and what needs to be changed.

If it looks like I haven't seen your pull request send me a message on Facepunch or post in the main thread.
