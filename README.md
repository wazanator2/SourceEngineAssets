<B>How to commit</B>

To start navigate to the folder you wish to contribute to. For this example lets assume you are contributing some brick materials so you would go to the materials/brick folder. You would then put your brick textures .vtf and .vmt into this folder. Next you would open up the Credits.txt file (or create one if it doesn't already exist) and add the proper credits like so:

Textures Name       =        Original Artists Name

Next you would go to the folder you contributed to (in this case materials), right click and choose "SVN Commit..." put in a nice description of what you are adding and choose the files you added/updated then click OK.
